# Unit 2: Questioning and Processing

Welcome to the second unit of Advanced Prep! This unit is designed to help you develop the core skills necessary for excelling in the Advanced AET admissions process. We will focus on enhancing your ability to formulate probing questions, gather and analyze information, and generate original ideas. Let's continue your journey to success! {{ className: 'lead' }}


## 2.1: Questions/Processes are Probing and Specific

- **Develop In-Depth Questions:**
  - Aim to ask questions that delve deeply into the subject matter. Avoid surface-level questions.
  - Example: Instead of asking "What is climate change?" ask "How do greenhouse gases alter the Earth's energy balance, and what feedback mechanisms amplify or mitigate these effects?"

- **Focus on Specific Details:**
  - Avoid vague or broad questions. Be precise and clear about what you want to know.
  - Example: Instead of "Why is this important?" ask "What specific molecular pathways are affected by this protein, and how does its dysfunction contribute to the disease phenotype?"

- **Target Key Concepts:**
  - Direct your questions towards the main ideas and critical points of the subject matter.
  - Example: Instead of "What happened?" ask "What were the key experimental observations that led to the formulation of the cell theory, and how did they challenge prevailing scientific beliefs of the time?"

## 2.2: Poses Open-Ended Questions

- **Encourage Detailed Responses:**
  - Formulate questions that require more than a simple "yes" or "no" answer. These questions should invite detailed explanations and discussions.
  - Example: Instead of "Did this experiment work?" ask "In what ways did the results of this CRISPR gene-editing experiment support or refute the initial hypothesis, and what unexpected cellular responses were observed?"

- **Promote Exploration of Different Perspectives:**
  - Ask questions that allow for multiple viewpoints and interpretations.
  - Example: Instead of "Is this method effective?" ask "How might researchers from different fields such as molecular biology, ecology, and bioinformatics interpret these results, and what interdisciplinary approaches could provide a more comprehensive understanding?"

- **Stimulate Critical Thinking:**
  - Use questions that challenge the respondent to think deeply and consider various aspects of the topic.
  - Example: Instead of "What is the solution?" ask "What are the potential solutions to antibiotic resistance, considering both novel drug development and alternative approaches like bacteriophage therapy, and what are the long-term implications of each strategy?"

## 2.3: Highly Developed/Purposeful Exploration of Thought Which Challenge Assumptions

- **Critically Analyze Assumptions:**
  - Go beyond accepting information at face value. Question the underlying assumptions and consider their validity.
  - Example: Instead of accepting "This method is effective," ask "What assumptions underlie the belief that this PCR method is effective for all types of DNA samples, and how might these assumptions limit its applicability in forensic science?"

- **Engage in Thoughtful Examination:**
  - Delve into why certain beliefs or viewpoints are held. Consider alternative perspectives and the evidence supporting them.
  - Example: Instead of "This is the best approach," ask "What are the assumptions behind considering CRISPR as the best approach for genetic modification, and are there alternative gene-editing technologies that might be more suitable for certain applications?"

- **Challenge Existing Beliefs:**
  - Encourage a mindset of questioning and re-evaluating commonly held beliefs and viewpoints.
  - Example: Instead of "Everyone agrees this is true," ask "What recent experimental evidence challenges the central dogma of molecular biology, and how might this reshape our understanding of gene expression and inheritance?"

By mastering these skills, you will be well-equipped to excel in the Advanced AET admissions process, demonstrating your ability to think critically and engage deeply with complex scientific material.
